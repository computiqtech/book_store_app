* It's ok to use icons packages.
* Use Getx for state management.

## UI
### Main Page
The main page should contain a list of the available books. When tapping on a book, the second page (Book Details Page) will be navigated. Use Scrollable view for the list of books. ALso there is a simple search on the top of the page.

This have the details of the book which is:
- Book name
